Flooding occurs almost every year in Jakarta during the rainy season, including earlier this year in 2020. This is considered alarming because the scale of the flooding impact has increased rapidly in recent decades. The increase was related to a number of drivers, both physical (climate change) and socio-economic (population growth). This proposed a new approach based on the impact of both factors on flood risk, considering flood hazard and vulnerability in quantifying risk using an index-based approach. Spatial analysis is utilized to create thematic maps used to identify the geographical variation of flood risk among subdistricts. The result indicates that 16 percent of Jakarta subdistricts, mainly concentrating around Central, West, and North Jakarta, have a high risk of flooding.
