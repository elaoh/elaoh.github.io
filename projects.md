  <h3>Empowering Cloud Computing for Non-image-based Diabetic Retinopathy Screening by Designing an EHR-oriented Incremental Learning Framework</h3>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This NIH-funded project aimed to address the scalability and adaptability challenges of AI models for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in primary care. By leveraging cloud computing, the project developed an EHR-compatible incremental learning framework that could continuously learn from new patient data without retraining from scratch. This non-image-based approach utilizes routine lab results and comorbidity data‚Äîmaking it more accessible, especially in rural or resource-limited settings‚Äîwhile achieving comparable accuracy to image-based DR screening tools.</p>
