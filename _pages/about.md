Research Interests
------
My current research interest is to develop explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) frameworks and methodologies to support descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics as motivated by and applied to high-stake decision-making support systems. I am especially interested in modeling, optimizing, and making applicable recommendations for industrial-related systems to improve the decision-aid system's quality and adaptability.\
**Methodology**
Descriptive modeling, predictive modeling, data analytics, text analytics, statistical learning, multivariate analysis, applied statistics, clustering algorithm, classification algorithm, time series analysis, perturbation method, cognitive analytics, and physiological measurement.\
**Applications**
Healthcare system, power system, route configuration, supply chain design, time series prediction, customer relationship analytics, sentiment analysis, and trends analytics.
